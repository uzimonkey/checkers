# Checkers

checkers.c is a simple implementation of the game of checkers. At around 200 lines of code, it should be short enough to understand for any student of C. While (apparently) fully functional, the user interface is much too primitive to actually enjoy the game.

Compile with `gcc -Wall -std=c11 -pedantic checkers.c -o checkers`
